## language-rsemail

This is a "grammar" package for the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor. It
is meant for email composition according to my personal tastes in
terms of line length, tab style, quote-level-highlighting, etc.

P.S.: The initial release is tagged as 0.1.3 because "apm publish" croaked a few
times.
