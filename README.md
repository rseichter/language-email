This is a grammar package for the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor. It is meant
for email composition based on "netiquette" that has made handling email easier
for decades. This package comes with reasonable defaults for line length, tab
style, quote-level highlighting, etc. but these settings can be customised,
should you so desire. It also includes a basic cleanup-text-feature.

Please see [this Wiki](https://github.com/rseichter/language-email/wiki) for more information.
